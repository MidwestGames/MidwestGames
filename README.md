Howdy everyone, welcome to the atrocious designs I have created. 
Anything here is probably horribly optimized and buggy as hell.

I mainly am using this for game jam source code, but other repositories may exist.
If you have any questions about anything, 

  Email: heyinglogan@gmail.com

I hope you can read anything I post here

PS - [My resume is found here](main.pdf), check it out!

Happy trails!
